LSB Scanner
- Make LSB header changes persistent across init script updates.

This has two modes of operation; Pre-Scan and Post-Write

In Pre-Scan mode:
- Read the LSB header of the named init script and records the chkconfig,
  Required-Start, Should-Start, Required-Stop, Should-Stop, Default-Start,
  Default-Stop and Default-Enabled. 
- These will be stored as "variable = value" pairs in the destination
  directory ('/etc/sysconfig by' default) under the name
  '<program>.lsb.conf'.

In Post-Write mode:
- The '<program>.lsb.conf' file will be read into memory.
- The named '/etc/init.d/<program>' file will be read up to
  '### END INIT INFO'.
- The read value will be compared against the stored value, if any. If there
  is a difference, the LSB line will be updated to match the stored value.
- The modified init script will be re-written *only* if a value was changed.
- If a change is made, the original copy of the init script will be backed up
  to '/etc/sysconfig/lsb-scanner.<program>.init.backup.<timestamp>' before the
  changed init script is written.
